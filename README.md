# GLSL Godrays single step

* The calcu function only returns a value when the y component of the input is greater than a threshold; this acts as a simple mask to reduce certain contributions.

* Layered Bayer dithering (Bayer2 → Bayer64) provides structured noise to reduce banding; can be replaced with blue-noise for better quality.

* Using rand(floor(... + time * 0.51)) creates temporal (moving) noise. For temporal stability, use frequency-controlled noise or temporal reprojection.

* Performance: very light at least by today's device standards.
